 * then those modules are automatically added as delegates during the asynchronous execution of this method.
 *
 * The registerModule method is asynchronous.
 *
 * The unregisterModule method unregisters the module with the connector,
 * and automatically removes it as a delegate of any other module.
 *
 * The unregisterModule method is fully synchronous.
 * That is, after this method returns, the module will not be scheduled in any more delegate calls from other modules.
 * However, if the module was already scheduled in an existing asynchronous delegate call from another module,
 * the scheduled delegate invocation remains queued and will fire in the near future.
 * Since the delegate invocation is already queued,
 * the module's retainCount has been incremented,
 * and the module will not be deallocated until after the delegate invocation has fired.

 *
 * This may also be useful to clients, for example, to add a delegate to instances of something like ChatRoom,
